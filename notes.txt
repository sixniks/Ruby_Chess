Check for valid move using transformation sets

To check for collision:
We can say if we are at this space and moving this way 
to another space then we must have passed these spaces
SO 
  A rook moves from [1,1] to [1,4]
  We can take everything in between [1,1] and [1,4]
  or we can say y+1 y+1 y+1
  A queen moves from [5,1] to [1,5]
    [4,2]
    [3,3]
    [2,4]
    [1,5]

      SO we can take current pos 

Keep track of pieces with something like
    [ [3, 4, 'Rook'],
      [3, 4, 'pawn'],
      [3, 4, 'pawn'],
      [3, 4, 'pawn'] ]
  end

  check transforms that could move to king pos to check for CHECK and CHECKMATE
  If black can move to white king then 
    then compare all black transforms to white king transforms for checkmate
  If black can move to where white would move checkmate
